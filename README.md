# Mern-Ecommerce-website

### the main objectif of this projet was to make a smooth Ecommerce website that handles both sides (client and admin).

#### In this project I have worked with :

1. Mern stack :

- MongoDb
- Express
- React
- Nodejs

2. chakra UI
3. Redux to clean our code.  
   have also add a fake payment to the order using the paypal api (sandbox).

Here is how admin panel looks :
